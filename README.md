# Secure Infrastructure Gateway

A small self-hosted WireGuard access gateway with a web UI. Users sign in
(password or GitHub OAuth), download a WireGuard config, and activate
per-service access for short sessions. Only the IPs of services they've
activated are routed through the tunnel; everything else stays on their
normal connection. Services behind the gateway are completely unreachable
from the public internet.

Built with Flask + a thin wrapper around `wg`/`iptables`/`conntrack`.
Runs as a single Docker container. Roughly 1500 lines of Python + HTML.

---

## Why

You have a handful of internal services (Postgres, SSH bastion, OpenShift
console, Grafana, ...) that you'd rather not expose directly to the
internet. You still want engineers to reach them from their laptops with
normal clients — `psql`, `ssh`, a browser — with certificates that
validate cleanly against the real hostnames.

This tool lets you hand out a WireGuard config, then gate *which*
destinations that config can actually reach from a web dashboard, per
user, per service, with a time limit.

---

## How it works

1. Admin defines services in `config.yaml` — each with a hostname and
   optionally a port.
2. User logs in to the web UI (password or GitHub OAuth, your choice)
   and downloads a personal WireGuard config. It includes every
   configured service's resolved IP in `AllowedIPs`, plus the gateway's
   own WG network.
3. User imports the config into their WireGuard client. Only traffic to
   those specific IPs is routed through the tunnel; everything else goes
   out their normal connection.
4. Before actually reaching a service, the user clicks **Activate** on
   the dashboard. The gateway installs a per-(user, service) iptables
   ACCEPT rule with a 1-hour expiry. The user can extend up to 8 hours
   of remaining time per service, and can keep re-extending forever.
5. When an activation expires (or is deactivated), the gateway removes
   the rule *and* kills in-flight `conntrack` flows, so open SSH / psql
   sessions drop within a second.

The WireGuard handshake uses a per-user preshared key on top of the
X25519 keypair, for post-quantum hedging.

---

## Features

- Per-user WireGuard identity (X25519 + 32-byte preshared key)
- Per-service activation with configurable expiry (default 1h, cap 8h)
- Automatic teardown on expiry; existing flows killed via `conntrack -D`
- Password login + GitHub OAuth (require org and/or team membership,
  optional admin team)
- OAuth membership is re-checked on an interval so removing a user from
  the team kicks their session out
- Admin dashboard:
  - See every user's WG IP, active grants with live countdowns, and
    blocked services
  - Revoke individual grants (kick)
  - Permanently block a service for a user
  - One-click **Lock out** to block every service for a user at once
  - Revoke a user's WG config entirely (peer removed, keys invalidated)
- Audit log in JSON Lines, with filter + pagination in the UI; rotated
  weekly and gzipped, archives kept for compliance
- Config-download confirmation dialog requires acknowledging a "do not
  share" clause before the private key is revealed

---

## Prerequisites

- **A Linux host.** Kernel 5.6 or newer (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+,
  Fedora 36+, or Arch). WireGuard is built into the kernel — no module
  install needed.
- **Docker** and the `compose` plugin (for the recommended deployment).
- **A public UDP port.** The VM must be reachable on `51820/udp` (or
  whatever you set `wg_listen_port` to) from every user's network.
- **A DNS name** pointing at the VM for production (Caddy uses it to
  fetch a Let's Encrypt certificate). Not required for a local test.
- **Outbound network access** from the gateway to the real services —
  the gateway resolves the configured hostnames via its own DNS and
  connects to them directly.

## Deploying it

One Linux VM (1 CPU, 512 MB RAM is plenty), kernel 5.6+:

```bash
# 1. Install Docker + the compose plugin.
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker

# 2. Firewall: let in SSH, HTTP/S (for the web UI + TLS), and WireGuard.
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw allow 80,443/tcp
sudo ufw allow 51820/udp
sudo ufw enable

# 3. Clone this repo onto the VM and create a config file.
git clone <this-repo> sig && cd sig
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
#   Fill in at minimum:
#     - secret_key   (python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))')
#     - session_cookie_secure: true
#     - trust_proxy: true
#     - wg_endpoint: gateway.yourdomain.tld:51820
#     - users and/or oauth.github
#     - services (your real internal hostnames)

# 4. Point a DNS A record at the VM and set the hostname in the Caddyfile.

# 5. Start everything.
docker compose up -d --build
```

Caddy fetches a Let's Encrypt cert automatically on first start and
reverse-proxies the web UI over HTTPS. WireGuard listens on a separate
UDP port and isn't proxied.

**Back up `./state/`.** It holds the server's WireGuard private key and
every user's peer assignment — losing it invalidates every config
you've handed out.

## Running without Docker (dev mode)

For UI tweaks on your own machine you can skip the container:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
#   Set  enable_netfilter: false  to skip the root-only ip/wg/iptables calls.
python app.py
```

The web UI will run but "Activate" is a no-op (no routing happens) —
useful for front-end work, not for real access.

## Configuration

See [config.example.yaml](config.example.yaml) — every field is
documented inline. Highlights:

| Field                         | What it does                                                       |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `secret_key`                  | Flask session signing key. Random 256-bit recommended.             |
| `session_cookie_secure`       | Restrict the cookie to HTTPS. Must be `true` in prod.              |
| `trust_proxy`                 | Honor `X-Forwarded-For` from a reverse proxy.                      |
| `audit_log_path`              | Path to the JSON Lines audit log.                                  |
| `audit_rotation`              | `weekly` / `daily` / `off`. Archives are gzipped and kept forever. |
| `wg_endpoint`                 | `host:port` the client's `[Peer]` section will dial.               |
| `wg_network`                  | WG subnet — gateway takes `.1`, peers get the rest.                |
| `wg_config_name`              | Basename of downloaded configs (<=15 chars).                       |
| `enable_netfilter`            | Set `false` locally to skip root-only commands and just run the UI.|
| `users`                       | Map of username -> bcrypt password hash.                           |
| `admins`                      | Usernames with admin privileges.                                   |
| `oauth.github`                | See section below.                                                 |
| `services[].hostname`         | Service hostname — resolved at startup + every 5 min.              |
| `services[].port`             | Optional port restriction. Omit for any TCP port.                  |
| `services[].cidrs`            | Optional explicit IP/CIDR list, merged with DNS results.           |

### GitHub OAuth setup

1. Register an OAuth App at
   https://github.com/organizations/<your-org>/settings/applications
   (org-owned) or https://github.com/settings/developers (personal).
2. Set the callback URL to
   `https://<your-gateway-hostname>/oauth/github/callback`.
3. Copy the client ID and generate a client secret.
4. Fill in `config.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   oauth:
     github:
       client_id: "Iv1...."
       client_secret: "..."
       required_org: "your-org"
       required_team: "infra"        # optional — org-only if omitted
       admin_team: "infra-admins"    # optional — these users get admin
       reverify_interval: 300        # seconds
   ```

5. If your org enforces *Third-party Application Access Policy*, an org
   owner has to approve the app once. Org-owned OAuth Apps skip this.

The app only requests the `read:org` scope.

### No password users?

Leave `users: {}` and `admins: []` — the login form will hide the
password fields automatically, leaving just the GitHub button.

---

## Day-to-day operations

### Add a password user

```bash
# On the VM (or locally, if you have bcrypt installed in a venv):
docker compose run --rm --no-deps \
  --entrypoint python gateway hash_password.py
# Prompts for a password, prints a bcrypt hash.
```

Paste the hash into `config.yaml`:

```yaml
users:
  alice:
    password_hash: "$2b$12$..."
```

Then `docker compose restart gateway`.

### Grant a user admin rights

Either add their username to the `admins:` list in `config.yaml` (and
restart), or — if you're using GitHub OAuth — add them to the
`admin_team` in GitHub. The admin team is re-checked periodically
without a restart.

### Add a new service

Append to `services:` in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  - name: grafana
    hostname: "grafana.internal.example.com"
    port: 443
```

Restart the gateway: `docker compose restart gateway`.
The hostname is resolved at startup and every 5 minutes thereafter.

**Existing users have to re-download their WG config** so the new
service's IP lands in their `AllowedIPs`. The dashboard shows a
*Rotate & download config* button for this (rotating their key, so
previous configs are invalidated instantly).

### Remove a service

Delete the entry from `config.yaml` and restart. Any active grants for
that service are dropped. Users will still have the (now-unused) IP in
their existing `AllowedIPs` — harmless, but they can re-download to
clean it up.

### View logs

```bash
# Application + request logs from the container:
docker compose logs -f gateway

# The audit log on disk — structured JSON per line:
tail -f logs/audit.log

# Read an archived (gzipped) week:
zcat logs/audit-2026-04-13.log.gz | jq .
```

The admin UI has a paginated, filterable view across the live file and
every archive.

### Update the gateway

```bash
cd sig
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

State (`state/`, `logs/`) survives because both directories are
bind-mounted from the host. WireGuard peers and user assignments are
preserved across upgrades.

### Restart cleanly

```bash
docker compose restart gateway
```

This brings `wg0` down and back up. Active clients reconnect
automatically within a few seconds.

### Back up state

```bash
tar czf sig-backup-$(date +%F).tar.gz config.yaml state/
```

`state/` holds the server's WG private key and every user's peer
assignment. Keep it safe.

### Verify it's working

From the VM:

```bash
docker compose exec gateway wg show
# Shows listening port + one entry per peer once they handshake.
```

From a client with the config imported and active:

```bash
sudo wg show
# Look for "latest handshake: N seconds ago" and non-zero transfer.

ping 10.77.0.1
# The gateway's WG IP; should reply as soon as the tunnel is up.
```

The built-in `/help` page (linked from the dashboard) contains a
Troubleshooting section covering handshake failures, DNS issues, and
why a specific service might not be reachable.

---

## User guide

There's a built-in `/help` page linked from every dashboard. It walks
through:

- installing WireGuard on Windows, macOS, Linux (with both GUI and CLI
  paths for Linux),
- importing the `.conf`,
- activating / extending / deactivating services,
- common troubleshooting (no handshake, can't reach service, etc.).

Nothing in that guide is admin-specific — it's aimed at the engineers
who'll actually use the gateway.

---

## Admin guide

Admins see two extra sections on the dashboard:

**Users table** — every account that has downloaded a WG config:

| Column            | Content                                                                       |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Username          | The username / GitHub login.                                                  |
| WG IP             | Their assigned private IP on the WG network.                                  |
| Active grants     | Green chip per active service with live countdown + `x` to kick.              |
| Blocked services  | Red chip per blocked service + `x` to unblock. Dropdown below lets you block. |
| Registered        | When they first downloaded a config.                                          |
| Actions           | **Lock out** (block all services; red), **Revoke config** (drop the peer).    |

**Audit log** — chronologically ordered, server-side filterable by
event category, service, user, and IP; paginated; reads both the live
file and every gzipped weekly archive so you can go back arbitrarily
far.

Admin endpoints:

| Route                                    | Purpose                             |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `POST /api/revoke/<user>`                | Remove peer + invalidate config     |
| `POST /api/admin/deactivate/<u>/<svc>`   | Kick a single active grant         |
| `POST /api/admin/block/<u>/<svc>`        | Permanently block a service        |
| `POST /api/admin/unblock/<u>/<svc>`      | Undo a block                        |
| `POST /api/admin/lock/<u>`               | Block every service in one click    |
| `POST /api/admin/unlock/<u>`             | Clear all blocks                    |
| `GET /api/audit?...`                     | Filter + paginate the audit log    |
| `GET /api/users`                         | Admin dashboard data feed           |

All admin POSTs are 403-gated for non-admins; all of them are audited
with the actor, target, IP, and reason.

### Audit log format

JSON Lines at `logs/audit.log`, one event per line:

```json
{"ts":"2026-04-20T09:12:33Z","event":"activate","user":"alice","ip":"203.0.113.7","service":"postgres01","expires_at":1745147553.4,"wg_ip":"10.77.0.3"}
```

Events you'll see: `login`, `login_failed`, `logout`, `session_revoked`,
`wg_config_generated`, `activate`, `extend`, `deactivate`,
`grant_expired`, `user_revoked`, `admin_deactivate`, `service_blocked`,
`service_unblocked`, `user_locked`, `user_unlocked`.

Rotation: every Monday 00:00 UTC (configurable) the live file is renamed
to `audit-YYYY-MM-DD.log.gz`, gzipped, and a new live file starts.
Archives are kept forever so compliance queries can reach back as far
as needed. Pagination in the dashboard reads across all archives.

```

**Process model:** one Docker container, one Python process. The web UI
and the WG/iptables control code share a common `Gateway` object
protected by a lock. Background threads handle expiry (`reaper`),
periodic re-resolution of service hostnames (`resolver`), audit-log
rotation, and the OAuth re-verify hook runs once per request above the
TTL.

**Why iptables, not a TCP proxy?** Direct routing is the only way to
preserve TLS certificate validation against the real hostnames. A
userspace proxy would break the chain of trust.

---

## Security model & caveats

**Strong:**

- The services behind the gateway are never reachable from the public
  internet. WireGuard's UDP port silently drops unauthenticated packets,
  so port scanners can't distinguish it from a closed port.
- Stealing one credential isn't enough: an attacker needs the login
  (password or GitHub), an active WG config, and an active per-service
  grant in the last hour. Every piece is revocable from the dashboard.
- Per-user preshared keys hedge the WG handshake against future
  quantum decryption of recorded traffic.
- `conntrack` teardown on expiry means "access expired" actually cuts
  the wire, not just future connections.

**The tradeoffs you're making:**

- The gateway becomes a concentrated target. Patch it, rotate
  `secret_key` and OAuth secrets on some cadence, back up `state/`,
  and watch the audit log.
- Admins can do a lot. Pick them carefully, and don't conflate admin
  access to the gateway with admin access to the systems behind it.
- This replaces "exposed services" with "one exposed admin panel." If
  the panel is compromised everything behind it is at risk, so don't
  treat this as an excuse to weaken auth on the services themselves.
